  * build timings in offline setup (#428 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/428>)
    Currently when using the offline setup, it does not build the per-point timing offsets which means when unpacking the packets in the offline mode, you cannot timestamp each point with its packet time.
    This commit does the following:
    - call buildTimings from setupOffline function
    - add model to setupOffline interface
    - set config model param which is needed by buildTimings
  * vls128: add line only once all four banks are processed (#413 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/413>)
  * PCAP timestamps & PCAP+GPS timestamps (#384 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/384>)
    * Add pcap_time param and implement gps_time with it
    * If gps_time == true, ignore pcap_time
  * Fixed row_step=0 when init_width=0 (dense cloud) (#404 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/404>)

    Adding VLP-32C support.
    This was tested by AutonomouStuff and several external users. Though it does not include new information that I've learned (it appears that the distance resolution is different <50m vs >=50m), it is a good start.
  * Merge pull request #189 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/189> from kveretennicov/patch-1
  * Fix malformed plugin description XML
    ROS pluginlib only recognizes multiple <library> elements if they are under
    <class_libraries> XML root. It silently ignores malformed XMLs with multiple
    <library> "root"s and just reads the first one, due to relaxed way tinyxml2 does
    parsing. Though if you do rosrun nodelet declared_nodelets, the issue is
    reported properly.

    Previously, transform_node has neither read parameters other than frame_id from the command line nor has it exposed these parameters via dynamic reconfigure. As parameters like max_range and view_width have been initialized to zero, the inconfigurable transform_node has returned an empty point cloud.
    Now, transform_node launches an reconfigure server just as cloud_node. In contrast to cloud_node, transform node exposes another parameter for dynamic reconfiguration: frame_id, i.e. the frame of reference the incoming Velodyne points are transformed to.
